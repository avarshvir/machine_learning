'''
Problem: You have a knapsack with a limited weight capacity and a set of items with weights and values. You need to select a subset of items that maximizes the total value without exceeding the weight limit.
Encoding: Each chromosome can be a binary string, where 1 represents including an item and 0 represents excluding it.
Fitness Function: The fitness score could be the total value of the items included in the knapsack encoded by the chromosome, considering the weight constraint.
