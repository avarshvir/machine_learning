Problem: Find the optimal values for hyperparameters of a machine learning model (e.g., learning rate, number of hidden layers) to achieve the best performance.
Encoding: Each chromosome can represent a combination of hyperparameter values.
Fitness Function: The fitness score could be based on the performance metric (e.g., accuracy) of the machine learning model trained with the hyperparameter settings encoded by the chromosome.
