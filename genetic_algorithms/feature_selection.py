'''
Problem: Given a dataset with many features, select a subset of features that are most relevant for predicting the target variable in a machine learning model.
Encoding: Each chromosome can be a binary string, where 1 represents including a feature and 0 represents excluding it.
Fitness Function: The fitness score could be based on the performance metric (e.g., accuracy) of a machine learning model trained using only the features encoded by the chromosome.
