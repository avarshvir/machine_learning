Problem: Given a set of cities and the distances between them, find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city.
Encoding: Each chromosome can represent a permutation of the cities, defining the visiting order.
Fitness Function: The fitness score could be the total distance traveled along the route encoded by the chromosome. Higher fitness scores correspond to shorter routes.
