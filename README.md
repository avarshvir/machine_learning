# Machine Learning
- Machine Learning is defined as "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.
- Machine Learning is a branch of AI that develops algorithms by learning the hidden patterns of datasets used it to make predictions on new similar type data, without exlicity programmed for each task.
